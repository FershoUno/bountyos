# bountyos

In this "CUSTOM" branch, all the changes that will be used as "suggestions" to improve the assembly of BountyOS will be developed.  

The changes are only focused on the AMD64 architecture.  

The bosamd64 directory was extracted from the Archive.zip file and removed because it is not needed for this branch.
